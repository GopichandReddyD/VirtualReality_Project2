# VirtualReality_CS_5331_Project_2
## Mission_Mars.......ElonMusk's Idea
### Abstract
The major aim of this project is to create a game which resembles the Elon Musk's idea of multi-planetary living. This game mainly concentrates on traveling to mars and creating a ecosystem where human beings can live their lives.

There are different levels of developing this ecosystem in this game which will be explained below.

### Introduction:

By seeing the growing population we guess elon's idea of moving to mars may come true in near future and we are trying to visualize his vision in the form of a game. This game goes in different levels/phases where ecosystem for human living will be developed eventually.

Initially considerable amount of people will move to mars to create human livelihood in phases. We have some discussed phases now and will improve accordingly

Discussed phases:
Phase1: To develop biosphere(oxygen, heat, gravity) for living by placing the area in a Biodome.

Phase2: To develop livelihood which includes farming, building houses and Industries.

### Team Contribution:

• Development: We are planning in splitting work with respect to phases.

• Testing: Initial testing will be done by respective phase developers.

• Final Testing: Final testing will be done by interchanging phases.

 
### Conclusion:

This project will give us oppurtunity in learning to design virtual spaces. Demonstrating an idea using 3D view will be the best part in future.
